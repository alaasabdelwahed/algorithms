This repository is my playground to explore different algorithms and how to solve them in Java.
They are divided into 2 files:
- GraphTraversal.java: This deals with problems concerning graph traversals, including bfs, dfs, finding shortest path, island count and minimum island.
- Algorithms.java: This deals with various unrelated algorithms such as top K elements, merging linked lists and pascal triangle.
